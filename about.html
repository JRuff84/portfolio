            For as long as I can remember, I've been passionately curious about how things come into being and have challenged myself to see things from different perspectives. Iâ€™ve spent my life exploring the crossroads between creativity and technology. Everything has a story, but the real magic is in discovering the amazing and impactful ways in which to tell it. When you pay close attention to the details, moments of inspiration arise and the missing pieces to even the most complex of puzzles become self evident.

            I love to discover and explore new concepts and ideas as much as sharing that knowledge and supporting those around me to become the best version of themselves. I have an innate ability to train, mentor, and inspire others to develop a deeper understanding of problems that often result in creative solutions that offer outstanding results. This has opened many doors and opportunities for me.

      <h4>Musician</h4>
      <p>
      I've been playing music all my life, but I picked up my first guitar at the age of 13 and haven't put it down since. I began playing in bands semiprofessionally after relocating to portland in 2005. Since then, I have been very greatful to have had the opportunity to play with and open for many incredibly talented acts including Everclear, The Presidents of the United States of America, The Cherry Poppin' Daddies, Floater, Powerman 5000 etc.

      <h4>Artist / Graphic Designer</h4>
      <p>
        Working in both physical mediums as well as digital, I love to create. Originally focusing on sketch work through mediums like graphite and ink on paper, and then later discovering charcoal before venturing into digital mediums like photoshop and graphics tablets, I've created branding and marketing material for artists, musician, and performers in addition to small businesses and companies. I've been honored to collaborate with Sean Moll (DC Comics) and have had had work featured in films presented in both Sundance and Cannes film festivals.
